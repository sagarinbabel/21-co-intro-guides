# Update - this project has been abandoned due to time constraints. 21.co turned into Earn.com which was bought by Coinbase. In 2019 hoping to get more involved in crypto/blockchain efforts.

## 21.co Introduction Guide Translation Project

**Aim** - Translating the [21.co Introductory Guide]((https://21.co/learn/)) to various languages

I'm a big fan of [21.co](https://21.co/) - the product and the vision behind the product

The aim is to crowdsource the translation of the guide for new users/developers in as many languages as possible. 

**Current Languages WIP**
----

* [Spanish - Español](https://github.com/sagarinbabel/21co-intro-guides/blob/master/21co-intro-es.md)
* [Portuguese - Português](https://github.com/sagarinbabel/21co-intro-guides/blob/master/21co-intro-pt.md)
* [German - Deutsch](https://github.com/sagarinbabel/21co-intro-guides/blob/master/21co-intro-de.md)
* [French-Français](https://github.com/sagarinbabel/21co-intro-guides/blob/master/21co-intro-fr.md)

**Workflow**
 

1. Clone the repo
1. Branch off master
1. Name the branch with the language
1. Do your thing
1. Label the file in the format as shown in the other files already - 1 md per language
2. If its a new language, don't forget to update the README
1. Send in a PR

**That's it!**

Feel free to nitpick, literally anything that makes the document better and more accessible is welcome.

This is the first time I'm doing anything like this so *all* suggestions are welcome, whether its about how to organize better, market better. 

Also, this is completely unofficial and voluntary. I'm not getting paid for this, nor am I being endorsed or asked to do this in any way. 

If you do want to reach out, there are many ways. I suggest reaching me through [21.co inbox](21.co/sagard) - all proceeds go to [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
